                I think this site makes the content easy to read and gives a good description of the reasoning and information about the films. I looked at the source code and noticed many of the a href elements for a lot of the link and peripheral on the site. The actual real content of the body used more formating elements. One element that I was not exactly clear on was the "meta" element. My first guess was that It made changes globally to the page but when I looked it up I learned that it is actually more about content/data that goes on in the background.
